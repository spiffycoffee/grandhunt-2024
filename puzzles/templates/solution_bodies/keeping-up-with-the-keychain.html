1. Solve each crossword clue
2. Add a “key”-sounding word to the front or back of each answer. The new word can be
matched to one of the key descriptions
3. Insert the new word, one letter at a time, into the empty space of each key. Per the
examples, vowels are entered into top row and consonants in the bottom row, skipping
boxes based on the ordering of vowels and consonants
4. The “extraction” key is ASCII. Read the 8 bits of the key as 1's and 0s to get 8-digit ASCII
letters. Together these spell KEY4 S1 EP4 WD2 (5)
5. Key 4 is LOKI. For the TV show Loki, Season 1, Episode 4, Word 2 of the title is NEXUS

Loki was an unintended secret theme to this puzzle. But it makes sense the god of stories would weave himself in!
