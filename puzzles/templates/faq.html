        <p>{% blocktranslate %}If you&rsquo;ve never heard of puzzlehunts before, here&rsquo;s a very brief summary: in a typical puzzle, you receive some information and have to extract an answer out of it, which is almost always an English word or phrase. Puzzles can come in many different forms; the only real commonality is that you usually receive no direct instructions, so it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to make sense of the information you&rsquo;re given.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
        <p>{% blocktranslate %}If you are new to puzzles and are interested in seeing some examples, or if you&rsquo;re looking for some practice, we recommend looking at puzzles from other online hunts such as <a target="_blank" href="https://reddothunt.sg/2018">REDDOThunt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://puzzlepotluck.com/">Puzzle Potluck</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="https://caltechpuzzlehunt.org">Caltech Puzzle Hunt</a>.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

        <h4>What is a metapuzzle?</h4>
        <p>A metapuzzle is a puzzle that uses answers from the previous puzzles in the round, but you'll need to figure out how to use these answers to extract a final answer. You do not need to solve all puzzles in the round in order to solve a metapuzzle, though usually having more puzzles solved (and thus more answers) will make it easier to solve a meta.</p>

        <h4>How hard are these puzzles?</h4>
        <p>
            These puzzles are built to be solved by brand new puzzlers. The difficulty will increase as you solve more puzzles, so we recommend new puzzlers work in teams, but experienced puzzlers can attempt this hunt solo. We're aiming for a difficulty around the recent <a href="https://paradoxpuzzlehunt.com">Paradox Puzzlehunt</a> or <a href="https://hunt20.com/index.html">Hunt 20 Puzzle Hunt</a>. Hopefully this hunt will serve as a cooldown to the <a href="https://mitmh2023.com">2023 MIT Mystery Hunt</a>, as well as a fun introduction to online puzzle hunts!!
