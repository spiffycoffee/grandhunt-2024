            <li>Incorrect guesses and taking hints will <strong>NOT</strong> affect scoring.</li>
            <li>If you submit a partial answer, (i.e. a word or phrase you&quot;d find while solving but isn&quot;t the final answer), you may receive a message telling you to "Keep going!" or something similar. But you won&quot;t earn any points until you get the correct answer.</li>

            <li>{% blocktranslate %}You can use a hint to get help on a puzzle. This can be something like a nudge in the right direction (i.e. you give us your progress on the puzzle and we&rsquo;ll try to get you unstuck) or an answer to a question (e.g. &ldquo;Which answers to these crossword clues are wrong?&rdquo;).{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
            <li>If you feel that the hint didn't help you, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:{{ contact_email }}">{{ contact_email }}</a> and we can help further. Please try to reply back to the original email that you got your hint from, or include the previous hint(s) so we know what we have told you so far.</li>
            <li>We will do our best to answer hints as fast as possible, but please understand if it takes some time to get to you :) Hopefully, our hint system will not overload us.</li>
            <li>If you are out of hint credits, but are completely stuck, please let us know through email. We want people to have fun solving puzzles and will be more generous for casual teams.</li>
