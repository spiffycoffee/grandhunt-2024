1. Each step of activating The Lantern is shown in the extra markings on the blueprint, and
the step enumerations are shown in the extra markings on the note
2. Map each roundâ€™s meta answer with the corresponding emoji (boulder = THROW A
TEMPLE TANTRUM, floppy disc = TWIDDLE YOUR THUMB DRIVES, palette = WORK
HARD FOR THE MONET
3. Each step of activating The Lantern is showing in a physical sense another idiom that
matches the pun idiom in each meta answer. These new idioms match the enumerations,
and lead to the final answer of The Grand Heist!
