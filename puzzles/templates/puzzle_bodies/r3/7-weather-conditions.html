**Monday:** | Expect a calm evening with good visibility. Observe where the light of the moon or sun shines through the scattered clouds.  
**Tuesday:** | Watch out for the strongest four winds. These are expected to tear through the city, blocked only by the tallest skyscrapers.  
**Wednesday:** | Torrential rain will flood the city. Look out for water funneling into the lower regions. Those living in skyscrapers on the third storey or below are advised to evacuate.  
**Thursday:** | Opportunity for frozen water fun as temperatures drop. Ice will form where flooding occurs in regions where thermometers read zero.  
**Friday:** | Conditions unclear. Perhaps observing how the week went will help with a prediction.
