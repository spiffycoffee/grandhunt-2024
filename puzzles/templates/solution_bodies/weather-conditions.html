1. Complete each logic puzzle (Clouds, Four Winds, Moon or Sun, Skyscrapers,
Thermometers, Water Fun)
2. Monday: Find cells that are not part of clouds, and are part of the moon-or-sun loop, which
forms a D
3. Tuesday: Find cells that are part of a 5-strength wind, and are in a 1-4 level skyscraper,
which forms a U
4. Wednesday: Find cells that are filled with water, and are in a 1-3 level skyscraper, which
forms an L
5. Thursday: Find cells that are filled with water, and are in a thermometer that has nothing
filled in, which forms an L
6. Friday: The answer is the letters found from Monday - Thursday
