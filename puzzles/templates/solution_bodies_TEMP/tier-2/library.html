<p>Nine shelves of books, answer is nine letters. Each shelf has some vases, bowls, lying down books, etc on the left and a set of upright books on the right.  On the left, we can divide the objects into books and everything else (vases, bowls, shells).  We can interpret this as Morse code for two letters. These letters are the first and middle initials of well-known authors that generally use those initials.  Therefore, the authorâ€™s last name follows.
