1. This is a meta matching puzzle. The goal is to match up the right terms to the right mini-
puzzles, and solve them. The mini-puzzle answers and the leftover terms will be used forthe meta puzzle. In each mini-puzzle, the AI chat bot misunderstands or misconstrues the
prompt.

2. **Mini-puzzle 1:** The prompt mentioning “Similarish to English” is confused for “Simlish-to-
English”. For each question, translate the Simlish to English, answer the question in English using a matching term, and then translate the answer back to Simlish. Index by the Simlish
word by the point value to get CHECKMAR, which is CHECKMATE in Simlish. The members associated to the word that come in the highest quantity are PAWNS

3. **Mini-puzzle 2:** The prompt is misconstrued to be about latin abbreviations for clarify “ie”
and example “eg”. Find a word associated with each set of three clarifications or examples.
Add a corresponding “ie” or “eg” to the word, plus an extra letter, to get a matching term.
The extra letters spell CLARIFY WNER. Perform one last “clarify” action, adding “ie” to the
word, to get WIENER

4. **Mini-puzzle 3:** The prompt believes your favorite childhood thing is dinosaurs, but it
misconstrues the ask to change the dinosaur names by one letter. Identify each dinosaur
and off-by-one matching term. The changed letters will spell LIZARDS

5. **Mini-puzzle 4:** The prompt about the grille cipher is confused for a cryptic recipe. Each
step is a cryptic clue, where INGREDIENT needs to be replaced by a matching term, where
every answer is 8 letters longs. Insert the answers in an 8 x 8 grid, one answer per row.
Overlay a “grille” where each hole is at the nth column, one for each setting number. The
visible letters read ROTATE CW. Rotate the overlaying grille (not the letter grid) by 90
degrees clockwise. The new visible letters read THE WORKS

6. **Mini-puzzle 5:** The prompt is misconstrued to be about a maze, though it appears
unsolvable. Find matching terms that look like crossword clues. The answers to each clue
are in the maze. However, each word has to pass through a wall to work, losing a letter as it
does. Read the missing letters from start to finish to get GUARDRAIL

7. **Mini-puzzle 6:** The prompt is correctly identified as a word search, but the typical
rectangular shape is missing. Since the word search grid could either be 11x17 or 17x11,
construct both. In one grid, find matching terms that make “_____ WORD” phrases. In the
other grid, find matching terms that make “SEARCH _____” phrases. Take the crossing
letters from the WORD grid, with the crossing letters from the SEARCH grid, in reading
order, to get CONVENTION

8. **Mini-puzzle 7:** The prompt is confusing a counting rhyme with count the title. For each line,
find a matching term that completes the rhyme with the capitalized number, and makes
sense with the phrase. The phrase is cluing a fictional count across various media types.
Index the count's name by the counting number to get another count, MONTE CRISTO

9. **Meta-puzzle:** Match up the seven feeder answers with the seven leftover terms by
increasing letter count. Note that each matching term has GPT in order, referencing the real
ChatGPT that ChatOMG was inspired by. Take the three letters in the feeder answers that
line up with each GPT to get ANSWER LAST WORD IN INTRO. The last word in the intro
text is the answer

I've always wanted to make a meta matching puzzle, where you are given a number of smaller puzzle shells and need to figure out how everything fits together. 
I thought a theme around an AI chat bot that misunderstands you would be a funny theme to tie it together. I also used this as an excuse to write puzzles with a couple members of my small puzzle hunt team.
And yes, I did run this puzzle through ChatGPT to see if it could solve it!
